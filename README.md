## About

<p>
    Color Brain is decentralized application (dapp) powered by <a href="https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/1.3/">cartesi</a> rollups technology.
</p>
<p> 
    How It Works: Derek selects a random color within a given array (red, green, blue, yellow). The user inputs their guess, and the game informs them whether their guess of Derek's choosen color, is correct or incorrect. The game can continue until the correct color is guessed.
